        I'm a Computer Science student at the University of Virginia, passionate
        about pushing the boundaries of technology and creativity. As a Rodman
        Scholar in the top 5% of the Engineering School, I blend my love for
        software development and machine learning with my passion for jazz
        piano, creating unique solutions that bridge the gap between technology
        and art.
